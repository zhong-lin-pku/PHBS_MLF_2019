## Project goal
Our goal is to predict trends of stocks and their future prices. We will use classifiers such as SVM, decision tree and random forest to predict trends of stocks and then compare advantages and disadvantages of each algorithm. Then we will use models such as linear regression, SVM, random forest and Multi-Layer Perceptron to predict specific prices, again we will compare advantages and disadvantages of each model. Other skills such as k-fold cross-validation will also be applied.

## Data Description
We use trading data of Shenzhen Stock Exchange and Shanghai Stock Exchange from 2017-01-01 to 2019-12-31. Features include the opening price, closing price, highest price, lowest price, trading volume and turnover. The dataset is too large so we only upload part of it.
